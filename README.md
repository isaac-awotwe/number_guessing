# The Number Guessing Game

This is a simple but fun game!

The "computer" thinks of a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

The player's task is to correctly guess what the number is.

There are two levels of difficulty: If the user chooses "easy" level, they have 10 attempts, while "hard" gives 5 attempts to guess the number.

Where the player guesses a wrong number, they get to know whether the number they chose is too low or too high, making their task easier after every guess.
